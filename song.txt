Every time you come around,
You know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down,
I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before
My world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits
Lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits
Lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens aft–µr two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
