Every time you come around,
You know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down,
I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before
My world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits
Lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits
Lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens aftеr two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you



Every pure intention ends
When the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights
And then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits
Lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits
Lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens aftеr two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now
